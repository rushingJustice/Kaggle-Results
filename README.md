# Kaggle Results - EDA and Machine Learning
My Kaggle competition notebooks and submissions. 

This collection of Kaggle competition notebooks demonstrates my ability to:

1. Explore and visualize the data using plotting libraries, statistics and custom functions.
2. Load, clean, and prepare the data for modeling.
3. Train the model (choosing an algorithm, metric, train/test/holdout). Cross-validation and iterating over model params to combat bias/variance in model.
4. Using the model to predict on holdout/unseen data. 

The types of models seen in the notebooks vary from:<br>

regression-type models (time-series)
classification (single and multi)
Computer vision classification (using neural networks)
